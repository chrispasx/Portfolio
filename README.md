## Portfolio Website


  This is a fully responsive personal portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a sleek design that adapts to all screen sizes, providing an optimal experience across devices. The website showcases key projects, including a weather app, a password generator and a calculator. It also includes a contact form, allowing visitors to reach out directly (though further back-end setup is required for actual communication). The project utilizes Bootstrap Icons and Box Icons for clean and simple icons, and SweetAlert for enhanced user-friendly alerts.
